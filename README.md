# Fabric Test Resources
This repository is part of the [Hyperledger Fabric](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric) project.
It holds resources that are used by the Fabric tests and that need to be outside of the main Fabric repo.

See [Fabric PR #1617](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/pull/1617) for additional background.
